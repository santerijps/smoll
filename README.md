# Smoll Libraries
Smoll is a collection of small JavaScript libraries that intends to help with developing simple web sites
without investing time into figuring out how some state of the art frameworks and libraries work.
Smoll attempts to be as simple as possible, and to achieve this, the developer does not have to write any
JavaScript code. Instead, the functionality is configured by adding Smoll HTML attributes to HTML tags.

# Why Smoll?
- Lightweight
- It's pretty cool
